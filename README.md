# HEDSpython
Code for the Python tutorials of the "Humanitarian Engineering and Data Science" module.

As a first thing, please make sure you upload the file "initiation.ipynb" to your Google Drive and run it from there. This will copy all the necessary files, including the tutorials scripts, in your Drive. You can then run the tutorial notebooks directly from you Drive in Colab.

# Nomenclature
You can find the tutorial for each week under the name "Tutorial_weekNo.ipynb".
